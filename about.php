      <h2>About GoCast</h2>
      <p>GoCast is the brainchild of two Australians with an insatiable thirst for podcasts. We were always on the lookout for new shows but good recommendations were hard to come by. We wanted a centralised place to get the latest podacst news, reviews and ratings - kinda like iMdb for podcasts. So rather than wait for someone else to build it, we decided to do it ourselves.</p>

      <p>The GoCast platform is dedicated to bringing you thoughtful and thought-provoking analysis on podcasts. From our reviews on individual shows to our weekly guide of the best podcasts, you can find out what's new and great in the world of podcasting.</p>

      <p>If you've got a recommendation for a podcast or you produce a podcast yourself and would like to let us know, <a href="contact.php">get in touch.</a> We read every single email that comes in, so we promise to check out your recommendation or show.</p>
